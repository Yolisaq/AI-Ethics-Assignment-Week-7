# 🤖 AI Fairness Audit: COMPAS Recidivism Dataset ⚖️

## 🌟 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a **practical audit of AI fairness** using the COMPAS Recidivism Dataset.  
We analyze **racial bias** in risk prediction scores, apply **bias mitigation techniques**, and evaluate model performance and fairness metrics.  

**Key Goals:**
- Detect and quantify algorithmic bias 🌈
- Apply fairness-aware algorithms 🛠️
- Visualize disparities and evaluate model accuracy 📊
- Promote ethical AI design and responsible decision-making 🧠

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.13** 🐍  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation 📑  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualizations 📊  
- **AI Fairness 360 (AIF360)** for bias detection and mitigation ⚖️  
- **Scikit-learn** for logistic regression and evaluation 🧮

## 📂 Dataset
**COMPAS Recidivism Dataset**  
- Contains risk scores for criminal recidivism 🕵️‍♂️  
- Features include age, sex, race, prior offenses, and risk score 📝  
- Goal: Identify and mitigate racial bias in risk prediction
